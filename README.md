## Work Experience

### Bulb (Multiple roles) (October 2018 - June 2021)

[Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk/mission/) is a rapidly expanding and innovative green energy supplier, named the fastest growing company in Europe of FY19/20.

During my time at Bulb, I had three different roles which gradually lead me towards the decision to pursue Software Development.


\
**Project Lead (MAP Invoice Reconciliation)** (May 2020 - June 2021)

_Meter Asset Provider (MAP):_ a third party within the energy industry, responsible for the provision and ownership of gas and electricity meters 

- Bulb receives ~100 monthly invoices from ~30 different MAPs for the daily rental, removal, and non-return of meter assets, totalling >£60mil a year
- MAPs notoriously use inaccurate data for these invoices, resulting in millions of pounds of overcharges

Until May 2020 these invoices were paid in full, with no validation performed on the backing data. I independently created and automated a process to reconcile these invoices. As of June 2021 my work had saved Bulb over £1mil, and this figure will grow continuously now the process is up and running.

This role involved:

- Building and automating a process to check MAP invoice backing data against accurate industry data, and to dispute any identified overcharges
- Python, SQL, advanced Excel, git (self-taught)
- Root cause analysis on inaccurate MAP backing data, to develop internal operational processes which improve data passback to MAPs
- Project planning, roadmapping, and calculating quarterly targets
- Negotiating with MAPs to receive repayments

\
**Data Cleansing (Faster Switching) Lead** (January 2020 - August 2020)  

_Faster Switching:_ a nationwide initiative to allow consumers to switch their supplier within 24hrs (current industry standard is 21 days)

Industry databases contain outdated information. For Faster Switching to succeed these underlying industry databases must be accurate.

This role involved:

- Delivering a project to ensure Bulb’s industry data is up to date
- Basic Python, advanced Excel (self-taught)
- Building a robust process to validate monthly datasets from Ofgem
- Write comprehensive instructions for out-sourced operations assistants, with little knowledge of industry concepts

\
**Graduate Energy Specialist (Member Operations)** (October 2018 - January 2020)

Bulb’s Member Operations team functions without departments to provide a holistic, one-stop support service.

This role involved:

- A deep understanding of the energy industry to provide complete and informative member service
- Identifying the root causes of member complaints and completing complex operational tasks, which in other companies are handled by 10-15 departments, to resolve them
- Working quickly, multi-tasking, and prioritising effectively to reach demanding performance targets






## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2021 - October 2021)
<!-- - Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine -->

#### University of Birstol (September 2021 - June 2018)
_Mathematics MSci (Integrated Master's), First Class (Hons)_

- Achieved the highest mark of the year in Master’s unit Axiomatic Set Theory
- Completed written independent research projects between 20-100 pages in length
- Used various mathematical softwares, such as MATLAB, Maple, R and LaTeX
- Gained strong numerical, analytic and problem-solving skills and high attention to detail






## Skills

#### Problem solving

As a Maths graduate, I have an aptitude for logical thinking and a curious mindset. I'm always excited to identify and address the root cause of the problem I'm working on.

At Bulb, I lead a cash-preservation project on MAP Invoicing, which has saved Bulb £1mil and counting. The low data quality in the MAP invoices was in some part due to poor data passback between energy suppliers and MAPs. The process I developed claimed back money **after** Bulb have been overcharged. Alongside this I worked on addressing the root cause of these overcharges. I collated a large sample of meters with incorrect charges and anaylsed them to find patterns in which [dataflows](https://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-guides/data-flows/) were consistently missing or incorrect. After speaking with relevant third parties within the industry and collaborating with Bulb's dedicated Dataflow team, we developed a weekly operational task which would prevent meters from being charged incorrectly by MAPs in the first place.

#### Communication

I have strong written and verbal communication skills. Throughout university I volunteered as a Maths GCSE Tutor at an underprivileged school, and a Financial Inclusion worker for young homeless people. I also completed a paid summer internship in the Fundraising and Communication team of a local charity immediately after graduating. During my Data Cleansing (Faster Switching) role at Bulb, I was responsible for delivering clear, concise training resources to onboard Operational Assistants.


#### Other skills

- **Quick learner:** to be able to deliver quickly on my Data Cleansing, and MAP Invoicing projects at Bulb, I had to teach myself Python and SQL, and upskill in Excel
- **Self-starter:** a large amount of my work at Bulb was independent so it important (especially during lockdown) to stay motivated and make realistic work plans for my week
- **Meeting deadlines:** Bulb, as a rapidly growing company, had a fast working environment, things would change frequently and our targets were demanding
- **Attention to detail:** as a mathematician who chose to specialise in pure mathematics, dealing with the precise is in my nature



## Interests and hobbies

#### Nerd stuff
- I attend a weekly TDD mobbing session run by the Ladies of Code London group to practice katas in Python
- I'm teaching myself Flask (Python Web Framework) in my spare time
- I love playing video games (so lockdown was in someways a treat for me)

#### Sporty stuff
- Netball - I've played socially since I was at school, (at Univeristy I captained the Maths Society's Netball team), now I play at a weekly social league in London
- Yoga - I enjoy yoga for both the physical and mental wellbeing it brings me
- Running - I've done a half Marathon and would love to do more
- Badminton - at Uni I started the Maths Society's Badminton team
- Anything which involves running around and catching/throwing/or hitting things with a bat!
