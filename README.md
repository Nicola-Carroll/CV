## Work Experience

### Bulb (Multiple roles) (October 2018 - June 2021)

[Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk/mission/) is a rapidly expanding and innovative green energy supplier, named the fastest growing company in Europe of FY19/20.

During my time at Bulb, I had three different roles which gradually lead me towards the decision to pursue Software Development.

\
**Project Lead (MAP Invoice Reconciliation)** (May 2020 - June 2021)

_Meter Asset Provider (MAP):_ a third party within the energy industry, responsible for the provision and ownership of gas and electricity meters 

- Bulb receives ~100 monthly invoices from ~30 different MAPs for the daily rental, removal, and non-return of meter assets, totalling >£60mil a year
- MAPs notoriously use inaccurate data for these invoices, resulting in millions of pounds of overcharges

Until May 2020 these invoices were paid in full, with no validation performed on the backing data. I independently created and automated process to reconcile these invoices. As of June 2021 my work had saved Bulb over £1mil, and this figure will continue to grow for as long as the process is run.

This role involved:

- Building and automating a process to check MAP invoice backing data against accurate industry data, and to dispute any identified overcharges
- Python, SQL, advanced Excel, git (self-taught)
- Root cause analysis on inaccurate MAP backing data, to develop internal operational processes which improve data passback to MAPs
- Project planning, roadmapping, and calculating quarterly targets
- Negotiating with MAPs to receive repayments

\
**Data Cleansing (Faster Switching) Lead** (January 2020 - August 2020)  

_Faster Switching:_ a nationwide initiative to allow consumers to switch their supplier within 24hrs (current industry standard is 21 days)

Industry databases contain outdated information. For Faster Switching to succeed these underlying industry databases must be accurate. This role involved:

- Delivering a project to ensure Bulb’s industry data is up to date
- Basic Python, advanced Excel (self-taught)
- Building a robust process to validate monthly datasets from Ofgem
- Write comprehensive instructions for out-sourced operations assistants, with little knowledge of industry concepts

\
**Graduate Energy Specialist (Member Operations)** (October 2018 - January 2020)

Bulb’s Member Operations team functions without departments to provide a holistic, one-stop support service. This role involved:

- A deep understanding of the energy industry to provide complete and informative member service
- Completing operational tasks, which in other companies are handled by 10-15 departments
- Working quickly, multi-tasking, and prioritising effectively to reach demanding performance targets


## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2021 to October 2021)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Birstol (September 2021 - June 2018)
_Mathematics MSci (Integrated Master's), First Class (Hons)_

- Achieved the highest mark of the year in Master’s unit Axiomatic Set Theory
- Completed written independent research projects between 20-100 pages in length
- Used various mathematical softwares, such as MATLAB, Maple, R and LaTeX
- Gained strong numerical, analytic and problem-solving skills and high attention to detail

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Interests/Hobbies

#### Codey stuff
- I attend a weekly TDD mobbing session run by the Ladies of Code London group to practice katas in Python
- I'm teaching myself Flask (Python Web Framework) in my spare time

#### Sporty stuff
- Netball
