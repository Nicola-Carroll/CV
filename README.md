<!-- A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

<!-- 


I’ve always been interested in how things works. I chose to study Maths at university, and then further specialised in Pure Mathematics, because of how fundamental I felt it was to other fields.

My interest in software engineering started to emerge shortly after I graduated. While working for a rapidly growing start-up, it quickly became apparent that the most interesting and impactful solutions to business problems were tech driven ones.

After learning to code, I also found that I got the same type of enjoyment from programming as I did from Mathematics. This lead me to the decision to quit my job and enroll on the Makers Academy intensive 16 week bootcamp to become a Full Stack developer. -->

## Experience

### Bulb (October 2018 - June 2021)

[Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk/mission/) is a rapidly expanding and innovative green energy supplier, named the fastest growing company in Europe of FY19/20.

During my time at Bulb, I had three different roles which lead me towards the decision to pursue Software Development.


\
**Project Lead (Invoice Reconciliation)** (May 2020 - June 2021)

Bulb receives ~100 monthly meter invoices from ~30 different third parties for the daily rental, removal, and non-return of meter assets, totalling >£60mil a year. These companies notoriously use inaccurate data for their invoices, resulting in millions of pounds of overcharges for Bulb.

Until May 2020 they were paid in full, with no validation performed on the backing data. I independently created and automated a reconciliation process. As of Oct 2021 my work had saved Bulb over £1.3mil, and identified a further £8mil of potential savings.

This role involved:

- Building and automating a process to check invoice backing data against accurate industry data, and to dispute any identified overcharges
- Python, SQL, advanced Excel, git (self-taught)
- Root cause analysis on inaccurate backing data, to develop internal operational processes which improve data passback to relevant third parties
- Project planning, roadmapping, and calculating quarterly targets
- Negotiating with third parties to receive rebates from incorrect charges

\
**Data Cleansing Lead** (January 2020 - August 2020)  

_Faster Switching:_ a nationwide initiative to allow consumers to switch their supplier within 24hrs (current industry standard is 21 days)

Industry databases contain outdated information. For Faster Switching to succeed these underlying industry databases must be accurate.

This role involved:

- Delivering a project to ensure Bulb’s industry data is up to date
- Basic Python, advanced Excel (self-taught)
- Building a robust process to validate monthly datasets from Ofgem
- Writing comprehensive instructions for out-sourced operations assistants, with little knowledge of industry concepts

\
**Graduate Energy Specialist (Member Operations)** (October 2018 - December 2021)

Bulb’s Member Operations team functions without departments to provide a holistic, one-stop support service.

This role involved:

- A deep understanding of the energy industry to provide complete and informative member service
- Identifying the root causes of member complaints and completing complex operational tasks, which in other companies are handled by 10-15 departments, to resolve them
- Working quickly, multi-tasking, and prioritising effectively to reach demanding performance targets










## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2021 - October 2021)

Makers Academy is a 16 week software development bootcamp, comprising a mix of self-led learning, pairing sessions, and group projects.

- Refined Agile methodologies while collaborating within a team during fast-paced group projects
- Learnt how to pick up new technologies quickly, demonstrated by the delivery of the Acebook and Second Helpings projects, written in frameworks which the team had no prior experience of
- Developed understanding of OOP principles, TDD, MVC, DDD 
- Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, MERN
- RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Cypress

#### University of Birstol (September 2021 - June 2018)
_Mathematics MSci (Integrated Master's), First Class (Hons)_

- Achieved the highest mark of the year in Master’s unit Axiomatic Set Theory
- Completed written independent research projects between 20-100 pages in length
- Used various mathematical softwares, such as MATLAB, Maple, R and LaTeX














## Skills

#### Problem solving

As a Maths graduate, I have an aptitude for logical thinking and a curious mindset. I'm always excited to identify and address the root cause of the problem I'm working on.

At Bulb, I lead a cash-preservation project on Meter Invoicing, which has saved Bulb £1.3mil and counting. The low data quality in the meter invoices was in some part due to poor data passback between energy suppliers and third parties. I collated a large sample of meters with incorrect charges and anaylsed them to find patterns in which [dataflows](https://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-guides/data-flows/) were consistently missing or incorrect. After speaking with relevant third parties within the industry and collaborating with Bulb's dedicated Dataflow team, I developed a weekly operational task which would prevent meters from being invoiced incorrectly in the first place.

#### Communication

I have strong written and verbal communication skills. Throughout university I volunteered as a Maths GCSE Tutor at a local underprivileged school, and a Financial Inclusion worker for young homeless people. I also completed a paid summer internship in the Fundraising and Communication team of a local charity immediately after graduating. During my Data Cleansing (Faster Switching) role at Bulb, I was responsible for delivering clear, concise training resources to onboard Operational Assistants.


#### Other skills

- **Quick learner:** to be able to deliver quickly on the Data Cleansing and Meter Invoicing projects at Bulb, I had to teach myself Python and SQL, and upskill in Excel
- **Self-starter:** a large amount of my work at Bulb was done independently, so it was important (especially during lockdown) to stay motivated and make realistic work plans each week
- **Meeting deadlines:** Bulb, as a rapidly growing company, had a fast working environment, things would change frequently and our targets were demanding
- **Attention to detail:** as a mathematician who chose to specialise in pure mathematics, dealing with the precise is in my nature










## Interests and hobbies

#### Nerd stuff
- I'm part of the Ladies of Code London network, which includes a weekly TDD mobbing session to practice katas in Python
- I'm teaching myself Flask (Python Web Framework) in my spare time
- I love playing video games (so lockdown was in someways a treat for me)

#### Sporty stuff
- Netball - I've played socially since I was at school, (at Univeristy I captained the Maths Society's Netball team), now I play at a weekly social league in London
- Yoga - I enjoy yoga for both the physical and mental wellbeing it brings me
- Running - I've done a half Marathon and would love to do more
- Badminton - at Uni I started the Maths Society's Badminton team
- Anything which involves running around and catching/throwing/or hitting things with a bat!
