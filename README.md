I'm a recent Makers Academy graduate with previous experience of using Python and SQL to build new operational processes. I'm looking to move into a Junior Developer role where I can continue to learn new technologies, get to the root cause of business problems, and deliver elegant solutions.

<!-- 



I’ve always been interested in how things works. I chose to study Maths at university, and then further specialised in Pure Mathematics, because of how fundamental I felt it was to other fields.

My interest in software engineering started to emerge shortly after I graduated. While working for a rapidly growing start-up, it quickly became apparent that the most interesting and impactful solutions to business problems were tech driven ones.

After learning to code, I also found that I got the same type of enjoyment from programming as I did from Mathematics. This lead me to the decision to quit my job and enroll on the Makers Academy intensive 16 week bootcamp to become a Full Stack developer. -->

## Experience

### Project Lead (Invoice Reconciliation) | Bulb
**(May 2020 - June 2021)**

[Bulb Energy](https://bulb.co.uk/mission/) receives monthly meter invoices from third parties totalling >£60mil a year. These invoices are based on notoriously inaccurate data, resulting in millions of pounds of overcharges for Bulb, which until May 2020 were paid in full.

I independently created and automated a reconciliation process for these invoices. As of Oct 2021 my work had saved Bulb over £1.3mil, and identified a further £8mil of potential savings.

- Designed and automated a process to check invoice backing data against accurate industry data, and disputed identified overcharges
- Self-taught tech and tools: Python, SQL, Excel, Git, GitHub, APIs, Mode, GCP, Jira, Trello, Confluence
- Ran root cause analysis on inaccurate invoice data, then developed reactive operational processes to improve data passback to relevant third parties
- Composed a metering invoice query which was used by the data science guild to build a comprehensive company-wide “Cost Warehouse”
- Owned project planning, roadmapping, and calculating of quarterly targets
- Negotiated with third parties to receive rebates for incorrect charges



### Project Lead (Data Cleansing) | Bulb
**(January 2020 - August 2020)**

Faster Switching is a nationwide initiative to allow consumers to switch their supplier within 24hrs (current industry standard is 21 days). This initiative was blocked by inaccurate data within industry databases.

I delivered a project to ensure Bulb’s industry data for 1.7mil accounts was up to date. Before handing over this project in August, I had successfully halved the number of problematic accounts.

- Built and semi-automated a robust process
- Self-taught tech and tools: Python, Excel, Mode, Trello, Confluence
- Wrote comprehensive instructions for out-sourced operations assistants who had little knowledge of industry concepts



### Graduate Energy Specialist | Bulb
**(October 2018 - December 2019)**

- Improved and ran complex operational processes to support 9 customer service teams 
- Acted as a escalation point for ops issues and customer complaints
- Worked quickly and prioritised effectively to reach demanding performance targets
- Delivered excellent customer service











## Education

### Makers Academy
**(July 2021 - October 2021)**

Makers Academy is a 16 week software development bootcamp, comprising a mix of self-led learning, workshops, pairing sessions, and group projects.

- Improved Agile ways of working during fast-paced group projects
- Quickly picked up new technologies to deliver four projects, each using different tech stacks 
- Converted project requirements into user stories and workable tickets
- Developed understanding of OOP principles, TDD, MVC, DDD. Applied them to produce clean, high-quality code
- Professional use of GitHub (PRs, code reviews, CI services)
- Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, MERN
- RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Cypress

### Mathematics MSci, First Class (Hons) | University of Bristol
**(September 2021 - June 2018)**

- Achieved the highest mark of the year in Master’s unit Axiomatic Set Theory
- Completed written independent research projects between 20-100 pages in length
- Used various mathematical softwares, such as MATLAB, Maple, R and LaTeX














## Skills

### Problem solving

As a Maths graduate, I have an aptitude for logical thinking and a curious mindset. I'm always excited to identify and address the root cause of the problem I'm working on.

At Bulb, I lead a cash-preservation project on Meter Invoicing, which has saved Bulb £1.3mil and counting. The low data quality in the meter invoices was in some part due to poor data passback between energy suppliers and third parties. I collated a large sample of meters with incorrect charges and analysed them to find patterns in which [dataflows](https://www.businessjuice.co.uk/energy-guides/data-flows/) were consistently missing or incorrect. After speaking with relevant third parties within the industry and collaborating with Bulb's dedicated Dataflow team, I developed a weekly operational task which would prevent meters from being invoiced incorrectly in the first place.

### Transparency and communication

I have strong written and verbal communication skills. Throughout university I volunteered as a Maths GCSE Tutor at a local underprivileged school, and a Financial Inclusion worker for young homeless people. I also completed a paid summer internship in the Fundraising and Communication team of a local charity immediately after graduating. During my Data Cleansing (Faster Switching) role at Bulb, I was responsible for delivering clear, concise training resources to onboard Operational Assistants.


### Other skills

- **Quick learner:** to be able to deliver quickly on the Data Cleansing and Meter Invoicing projects at Bulb, I had to teach myself Python and SQL, and upskill in Excel
- **Self-starter:** a large amount of my work at Bulb was done independently, so it was important (especially during lockdown) to stay motivated and make realistic work plans each week
- **Meeting deadlines:** Bulb, as a rapidly growing company, had a fast working environment, things would change frequently and our targets were demanding
- **Attention to detail:** as a mathematician who chose to specialise in pure mathematics, dealing with the precise is in my nature
- I also have experience with **data-driven decision making**, **stakeholder management**, and **process design**











## Interests and hobbies

### Nerd stuff
- I'm part of the Ladies of Code London network, which includes a weekly TDD mobbing session to practice katas in Python
- I'm currently working on a solo project to really solidify my code quality when building a web-app
- I love playing video games (so lockdown was in some ways a treat for me)

### Sporty stuff
- Netball - I've played socially since I was at school, (at University I captained the Maths Society's Netball team), now I play at a weekly social league in London
- Yoga - I enjoy yoga for both the physical and mental wellbeing it brings me
- Running - I've done a half Marathon and would love to do more
- Badminton - at Uni I started the Maths Society's Badminton team
- Anything which involves running around and catching/throwing/or hitting things with a bat!
